  ([#3](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize/pull/3)), by [@localheinz](https://github.com/localheinz)
* Added the `PackageHashNormalizer` which sorts packages in the
  `conflict`, `provide`, `replaces`, `require`, `require-dev`, and `suggest` sections
  using the same algorithm that is used by the `sort-packages` option of
  composer itself ([#6](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize/pull/6)), by [@localheinz](https://github.com/localheinz)
* Added the `BinNormalizer`, which sorts entries in the `bin` section by
* Added the `ComposerJsonNormalizer`, which composes all of the above
  normalizers along with the `SchemaNormalizer`, to normalize
  `composer.json` according to its underlying JSON schema ([#8](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize/pull/8) and [#10](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize/pull/10)), by [@localheinz](https://github.com/localheinz)
